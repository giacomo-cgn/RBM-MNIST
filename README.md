# RBM based MNIST Classifier

This project was done for the ISPR course for the MCS course at University of Pisa.

A single hidden layer Random Boltzmann Machine is trained on MNIST dataset. A simple classifier is then trained over the RBM hidden encodings. Results and considerations are shown in this notebook.
