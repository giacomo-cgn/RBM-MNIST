# RBM based MNIST Classifier

This project was done for the ISPR course for the MCS course at University of Pisa.

In this notebook a **manually implemented** in Python Random Boltzman Machine is presented. The single hidden layer RBM is then trained on MNIST dataset. A simple classifier is finally trained over the RBM hidden encodings. Results and considerations are shown in this notebook.
